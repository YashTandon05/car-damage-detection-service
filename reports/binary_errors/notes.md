## False Negatives – Car Damage Detection Model

- **Extreme lighting conditions** (glare, shadows, over/underexposure) obscure visual damage cues.
- **Heavily dented panels** with smooth, uniform deformation lack sharp features the model detects.
- **Dents viewed from far away or straight-on angles** reduce depth, contrast, and pixel-level detail.
